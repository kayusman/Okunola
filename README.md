MY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Application of Factorial Design to Study the Effect of Maize yield using 3 factorial design.	       [Feb 2020 – March 2021]
The aim of the research work is applying a three factorial design to determining the significant effect of fertilizers, water volume, and herbicides on the yield of maize. Each factor is at three levels, fertilizers levels {N:P:K(20:10:10), N:P:K(15:15:15), and UREA}, herbicides levels (Altraforce, Xtraforce and Metaforce) and water volumes levels (5litres, 7.5litres, and 10litres). The maize (Soar 1) was planted, the herbicides (Altraforce, Xtraforce and Metaforce) were applied a day after planting, the water volumes (5Litres, 7.5Litres and 10Litres) were applied everyday according to how the ridges were segmented irrespective of rainfall.
And the Objectives of my research work are:
o	to determine the significant difference in the effect of fertilizers on the yield of maize.
o	to examine the significant interaction effect of the three factors on the response (maize).
o	to test the residual and homogeneity of variance assumptions.
o	to determine the optimal region of the effect combination that can be used for prediction of the model.
